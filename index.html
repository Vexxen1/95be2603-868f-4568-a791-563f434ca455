        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>If you are not my mom, or my sister, or me(hello me). Then get the fuck out of here. This is my fucking personal website, and it has no use for you.</p>
        <p>Anyway, if you are mom, or my sister. Welcome. I made this in a single day. A infinitely modifiyable list of all my best ideas for presents, or gifts for me. Click on changelog to see the most recent updates to the list. While click on 'View List', to see the list. You can sort the list, filter the list, and more! Yay! It even comes with links, and priority! So you can see how much i want something, and even sort by it. (Plus i made it eazy for me to add on more stuff to it.)</p>
